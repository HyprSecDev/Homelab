# ☁️ Cloud Security Homelab

A fully documented 6-week project designed to build a hybrid on-prem + AWS cloud environment, showcasing practical skills in cybersecurity, networking, and cloud architecture. This project serves as both a learning journey and a professional portfolio piece.

---

## 🎯 Objective

To create a secure, hands-on cloud homelab that demonstrates:

- Network security and segmentation
- Secure cloud deployment using AWS best practices
- Logging, monitoring, and alerting for incident detection
- Infrastructure automation using modern DevOps tools
- Vulnerability assessment and hardening procedures

---

## 📁 Repository Structure
- /docs → Diagrams, documentation, and notes
- /configs → Configuration files for VMs, firewalls, Terraform, etc.
- /images → Network topology maps, screenshots, visual content

---

## 🗓️ 6-Week Breakdown

### 📌 Week 1: Homelab Foundations
- Built virtual network using VirtualBox, pfSense, and Ubuntu Server
- Created and documented a network topology
- Set up GitHub project structure

### 📌 Week 2: AWS Core & Hybrid Connectivity
- Deployed AWS VPC, subnets, and EC2 instances
- Configured IAM roles, MFA, and secure remote access
- Enabled CloudTrail and AWS Config

### 📌 Week 3: Containers & Automation
- Deployed containerized services using Docker & Docker Compose
- Wrote Terraform scripts and Ansible playbooks
- (Optional) Created ECS or EKS clusters for cloud-native deployment

### 📌 Week 4: Logging & Monitoring
- Deployed Graylog or ELK Stack for centralized logging
- Integrated AWS CloudWatch, CloudTrail, and SNS alerts
- Documented log flows and alert logic

### 📌 Week 5: Vulnerability Assessment & Hardening
- Performed vulnerability scans with OpenVAS or Nessus
- Applied CIS Benchmarks and system hardening techniques
- Audited and documented AWS Security Hub findings

### 📌 Week 6: Capstone Build & Showcase
- Unified AWS and homelab into a single architecture
- Simulated security events and validated monitoring setup
- Finalized documentation, visuals, and GitHub presentation
